# My-m-and-a

Mission was to build a strong, robust, and scalable customers database for the exponential growth the company will soon have.
I have to merge their three customers (yes 3 :D) table into ours.


Our database schema:

"gender" - 'string'
"firstname" - 'string'
"Lastname" - 'string'
"email" - 'string'
"age" - 'string'
"city" - 'string'
"country" - 'string'
